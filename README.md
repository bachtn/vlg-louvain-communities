## Caveman Graph:
The connected caveman graph is formed by creating n cliques of size k. Then a single node in each clique is rewired to a node in the adjacent clique.

The (connected) caveman graph is a graph arising in social network theory formed by modifying a set of isolated k-cliques
(or "caves") by removing one edge from each clique and using it to connect to a neighboring clique along a central cycle
such that all n cliques form a single unbroken loop (Watts 1999). A number of cavemen graphs formed in this manner
from K\_5-e are illustrated above.
