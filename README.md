# vlg-louvain-communities

In this project, we generate very large Caveman graphs and determine the time of community detections

# To run the project:
> ./configure

or
> ./script.sh --nbr_graphs=100 --cave_size_start=5000 --nbr_caves_start=5100 --cave_size_step=50 --nbr_caves_step=50
* This will generates 100 * 100 graph with all the combinations between the nbr caves and the cave size
